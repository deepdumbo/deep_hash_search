First, you need to download the dataset and extract it:

	wget -c http://data.csail.mit.edu/places/places365/train_256_places365standard.tar
	tar -xf train_256_places365standard.tar

Then run 
	./train_test_split.sh
to split the dataset into training and testing parts

Now you can launch training with
	python3 resnet.py

after the model is trained and saved, you can run the sample website:
	FLASK_APP=web_pova.py flask run

Requirements: Keras, tensorflow, Flask
