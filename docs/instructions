First, you need to download the dataset and extract it:

	wget -c http://data.csail.mit.edu/places/places365/train_256_places365standard.tar
	tar -xf train_256_places365standard.tar

Then run 
	./train_test_split.sh
to split the dataset into training and testing parts

Alternatively, you can skip previous steps and download prepared toy data (small size) from http://www.stud.fit.vutbr.cz/~xjonjo00/data_small.tar.gz

Now you can run training:

To train with hard mining (web api available):

	launch training with
		python3 resnet.py

	after the model is trained and saved, you can run the sample website:
		FLASK_APP=web_pova.py flask run

To train without hard mining (web api not available):

	launch training with
		python3 model_noHardMin.py

To evaluate saved trained model run:

	python3 eval_results.py

Requirements: Keras, tensorflow, Flask
